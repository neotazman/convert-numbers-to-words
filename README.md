# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Convert Numbers to Words

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required sections are the **Project Plan** and **Reflection** below. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Project Plan

1. create a function to check if the input is a number
2. create an array to store the worded numbers
3. check if the number is between 9 and 20
    1. add those words to the successArray
4. turn the numbers into digits
5. check which position the digit is in the number
    1. convert the ones to Words
    2. convert the tens to Words
6. create a word for 0 and 100
7. turn the successArray into a string
8. loop through every number 0-100 and print the words on the page

## Reflection

What different approaches or techniques did you consider when planning your implementation? What were the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives?

honestly, i thought it would be way easier than it turned out to be, i can't figure out how else i would've implemented it
